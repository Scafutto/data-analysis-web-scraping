# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This is a simple project for Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (bs4) and Selenium, and data analysis using Pandas and Plotly. The goal of this project is to gather data on the top 20 CSGO players of every year, according to HLTV, and analyze it to extract meaningful insights.


- **Web Scraping**: The project uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas is used to manipulate the data and generate insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly is used for visualizing the data. Please note that the focus here is on functionality rather than visual design.

## To Do

Using a dataset from a sport that has more statistics available, such as chess. This would allow for better cross-referencing of data and potentially generate more useful and interesting insights.
